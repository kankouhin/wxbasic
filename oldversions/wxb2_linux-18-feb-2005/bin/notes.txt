There were a number of changes that had to be made to compile this for Linux.
The changes are _not_ reflected in the source code:

1. In main.c, the line

        #include <dir.h>
    
    was changed to:
    
        #include <unistd.h>
        
2. The following routines in wrap.cpp had the body of the routines
    commented out (so they were functionless stubs):
    
        wxFTP_SetTransferMode
        wxDateTime_GetMonthName
        wxImageList_Replace
        wxInputStream_Eof
        
Hopefully these will be corrected in the next source release.


The build flags I used when configuring wxWidgets were:

    ./configure --with-gtk --disable-shared --enable-threads
    
You can also refer to this thread on the wxBasic board if you have
questions of how to compile it:
