FIXME: add AS to For variable declarations

FIXME: added check for acos() range, need to see if other math
        functions need range checks

FIXME: dimming multiple items and assigning to a function that
        returns multiple values is not compatible:

            dim a, b, c = 1, 2, 3

        doesn't work as expected - a and b don't get assigned.

FIXME: errors are being caught, but the program isn't shutting
        down gracefully.

FIXME: add a counter to keep track of the number of times a routine has
        been executed. If it's the first time, initialize the STATIC
        variables to their default values.

FIXME:  It looks like there's a bug in how wxBasic searches for locals
        vs. global variables. It looks like it will set up a local
        without it needing to be explicity declared if it's found in a
        prior function (not global space)

FIXME: wxStaticBitmap is commented out
       wxStaticLine doesn't exist

FIXME: "Error in Include" error message doesn't show line number

FIXME: Count and Insert don't work with strings anymore

FIXME: recursion depth exceeded will crash without error

FIXME: bug in IDE:
    Conversion error: Can't perform inequality test on string against nothing

FIXME: the following use int*, and need to be replaced with wrappers:

%builtin void wxDisplaySize(int *width, int *height)
%builtin int wxGetOsVersion(int *major = NULL, int *minor = NULL)
virtual void SetStatusWidths(int n, int *widths)
void CalcScrolledPosition( int x, int y, int *xx, int *yy) const
void CalcUnscrolledPosition( int x, int y, int *xx, int *yy) const
virtual void SetStatusWidths(int n, int *widths)



FIXME: Need to add wxLocale, added wxGetTranslation
       add _() or _T() for tranlated strings
       finish work on trans.wxb, perhaps add built-in editor

FIXME: FindFirstFile is broken

FIXME: (Bruce Atkins): the CWD shouldn't be set for non-bound files.
        Need to experiment with this. The problem is:
            ..\wxbasic .\myfile.bas

        vs.
            ..\wxbasic myfile.bas

        which simply fails...
                        

FIXME: add Disconnect for specific events, and all events. Call
       the disconnect routine when destroying objects.

FIXME: put back OpenGL support

FIXME: check reading args after binding.

FIXME: check reading from right directory after binding.

FIXME: check rmdir routine.

FIXME: wArray:ToChar should be fixed

FIXME: Add support for additional args in hasKey

FIXME: track IDs, so that it's possible to find the wxBasic
       version of an object given the ID. One problem is making
       the search quick, another is making sure the object is
       removed from the table when it's destroyed.

FIXME: add Try in wrapper calls, so they can be recovered from.

FIXME: DateDiff is missing

FIXME: Missing methods for hours, minutes, seconds, and so on.

FIXME: wrap.lua errors on symbols if there are trailing spaces.
       add trim function call, and convert to wxBasic.

FIXME: Table[3] = Nothing can't remove the item, because by the
    time the code's been exectuted, it's forgotten that it's a table.

FIXME: this doesn't work:

        print {1,2,3}[2]

FIXME: The following wrapper fails under 2.4.2
    // int GetCursor();
    void wxStyledTextCtrl_GetCursor()
    {
        
        int returns;
        // call GetCursor
        returns = ((wxStyledTextCtrl *)(wTheCall->self->ptr))->GetCursor();
        wWrapDerefArgs();
        wStackPushNumber( (wNumber)returns);
    }

FIXME: setpen( undefinedVar ) crashes the app.



looks like the bug might be in PropByVal

bug: add trim() command
! add inTable() sort of operator for wTables


bug: deref in CALLMETHOD is probably still not right


Bugs:
    Object deref not working. Or maybe it is. Verify status, and
    fix if needed.

    Date conversion is wrong. Converting the date "January 12" doesn't
    work properly.

    Most of the date stuff is messed up, not the least which
    is the DateAdd function.

    Apparently the date format %c displays differently on different
    platforms. Fix.

    Attributes from superclass can be redefined, and they don't
    generate an error.

    Because INDEX returns an lval, setting an indexed value to Nothing
    will not remove the index. Instead, the Remove() routine has to be
    called explicitly.

To Do:
    Add 'me' check to properties as well.

    Add syntax:
        Dim <var> As New <type>( ... )
    Same as:
        Dim <var> As <type> = New <type>( ... )

    Add support for boxing constants, by creating a tmp variable to hold
    the object:
        "foo".length

    Track the number of times that a variable is set. If it is zero,
    issue a warning.

    Warn if variable is assigned in a branch, but not set before hand/
    set in each branch (probably too hard)

    Dump of bytecodes in XML format:
        <?xml version="1.0" ?>
            ...

    Add code to convert string to date/time

    Add the following date functions:
        DateAdd
        DateDiff
        DatePart
        DateValue
        TimeValue
        TimeSerial
        DateSerial


    Move these "builtin" routines that deal with the date to
    wTime.c

    add wTheClassScopeSymbol so I don't have to keep looking it up...

/* ASP Routines */
The following should be probably be added for compatibility
    Array       return an array
    DateDiff    number of intervals between two dates
    DatePart    part of a date
    Eval        someday...
    Filter      select subset of array, based on value. someday...
    InputBox    probably too GUI dependant
    IsArray     true if variant is an array
    IsEmpty     Except that there is no Empty is wxb
    IsNull      how about isNothing?
    Join        create big string out of collection
    LBound      hasn't this been coded yet?
    MsgBox      also probably GUI dependant
    ScriptEngine    hehehe. Don't think so.
    Split       split string into an array
    StrCmp      convert both to strings and compare.
    StrReverse  Should add this.
    TypeName    wxb has "typeOf"

/* PENDING ROUTINES */
wCode *wParseStatementDestroy()        { wParseError("Destroy not yet coded"); return NULL; }
